#  Executive Summary — DevSecOps & Application Security Project

This five-week **DevSecOps / Application Security Engineering** project demonstrates end-to-end capability in identifying, exploiting, and remediating security vulnerabilities within a full-stack web API.

Through practical implementation, I built, analyzed, secured, and deployed a **vulnerable authentication API**—mimicking real-world enterprise application environments—to showcase my ability to operate across **AppSec, DevSecOps, Threat Modeling, Cloud Security**, and **Secure SDLC** domains.

---

## **Key Deliverables**

* Built a **vulnerable Node.js authentication API** to simulate OWASP Top 10 flaws.
* Implemented **RBAC, JWT auth**, and demonstrated **privilege escalation attacks** and mitigations.
* Developed full **Threat Model (STRIDE)** and **Risk Analysis** framework for the API.
* Integrated **CI/CD Security Pipeline (SAST, SCA, DAST, Secret & Container scanning)** using GitLab and industry-standard tools (Semgrep, Trivy, GitLeaks, Snyk).
* Deployed the application to **AWS ECR + ECS + S3 + CloudWatch** following **least-privilege IAM** and **secure networking** best practices.

# Week-by-Week Technical Summary

## **Week 1 — Building a Vulnerable Application**

**Goal:** Develop an intentionally vulnerable Node.js API to understand how security flaws arise and are exploited.

### Vulnerabilities Simulated

* **Input Validation Failure** → NoSQLi & XSS.
* **Sensitive Data Disclosure** → Secrets in repo (.env, credentials).
* **Error Leakage** → Stack traces revealing backend logic.
* **IDOR (Broken Access Control)** → Direct user data manipulation.
* **Weak JWT Secret / Hardcoded Credentials.**
* **Plaintext Passwords** and missing password policy.
* **No Rate Limiting / Authentication Controls.**

### Learning Outcome

Built the foundation for AppSec understanding — identifying how **developer errors translate into exploitable attack vectors**.
Mapped vulnerabilities to **OWASP Top 10 / API Security Top 10** and validated mitigation techniques (input validation, secret management, error handling, rate limiting).

---

## **Week 2 — Authentication, RBAC, and Access Control**

**Goal:** Implement and exploit Role-Based Access Control, JWT management, and authorization flaws.

### Key Findings

* Weak JWT secret enabled **token forgery** → privilege escalation.
* IDOR allowed users to access other users’ records.
* Missing authorization checks enabled **admin-level destructive operations**.
* Excessive data exposure returned full user objects.

### Mapped OWASP Categories

* Broken Access Control (A01/API1)
* Broken Authentication (A02/API2)
* Excessive Data Exposure (A03)
* Security Misconfiguration (A05)

### Business Impact

* Unauthorized data access and account takeover.
* Potential **GDPR/PII violation**, regulatory fines, and brand damage.

### Remediation & Controls

* Strong random JWT secrets via environment variables.
* Middleware enforcing **`requireOwnerOrAdmin`** authorization pattern.
* Short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens.
* Secret scanning and CI enforcement.
* Audit logging and anomaly detection for admin endpoints.

## **Week 3 — Threat Modeling**

**Goal:** Create a full threat model using **OWASP Threat Dragon** and **STRIDE** to identify critical risks.

### Critical Threats Identified

| Threat                     | STRIDE Category                   | Severity |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------- |
| JWT Secret Exposure        | Spoofing / Elevation of Privilege | Critical |
| Insecure MongoDB Config    | Tampering / Info Disclosure       | High     |
| Plaintext Password Storage | Info Disclosure                   | Critical |
| Lack of TLS / HTTPS        | Spoofing                          | High     |
| No Rate Limiting           | DoS                               | High     |

### Mitigation Plan

* Implement secret rotation and vault management.
* Secure DB binding and enforce authentication.
* TLS enforcement + HSTS headers.
* Rate limiting and CAPTCHA on login.
* Harden IAM & deploy runtime monitoring.

**Result:** Produced actionable **threat model diagrams**, mitigation strategies, and detection controls — replicating the process used by AppSec engineers in design reviews.

---

## **Week 3 (continued) — Risk Analysis**

**Goal:** Quantify risk using **Likelihood × Impact matrix**.

### Critical Risks

* Hard-coded JWT secret → Critical (Privilege Escalation).
* Broken Access Control → Critical (Data Exfiltration).
* Plaintext Passwords → Critical (Credential Theft).
* No TLS / Rate Limiting → High.
* Exposed MongoDB → High.

### Risk Treatment

1. Remove secrets from code, enforce secret scanning (GitLeaks).
2. Secure password storage (bcrypt/argon2).
3. Enforce HTTPS only.
4. Apply express-rate-limit middleware.
5. Harden database and logging configurations.

### Outcome

Delivered a **Risk Register & Mitigation Plan**, ready for executive consumption — a skill aligned with **AppSec Governance and Security Architecture roles**.
